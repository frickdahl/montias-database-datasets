# Datasets from the Montias Database
With its Digital Art History Lab [DAHL]( https://www.frick.org/research/DAHL), the Frick Art Reference Library seeks to encourage the use of digital tools in art historical inquiry. By providing datasets, workshops, and access to tools, the DAHL hopes to facilitate collaboration between art historians and scholars from a variety of fields. The datasets presented here are from the [Montias Database](https://research.frick.org/montias) and have not been modified or augmented.

In the 1980s, Yale University Professor [John Michael Montias](http://research.frick.org/montias/home.php) began compiling the art inventories of residents of Amsterdam in the seventeenth century. Montias shared this invaluable resource with the Frick Art Reference Library to maximize its access to other scholars. The Montias Database comprises 1,280 inventories dated between 1597 and 1681; it records 51,071 individual works of art. Since Montias’s gift, art historians have accessed the data in a user-friendly, searchable format on the Frick’s website. However, the online database is ill-suited for data visualization and analysis. The Montias Database is presented here in the form of CSV and JSON files to encourage new academic projects.

The database is presented in two files: art objects and inventories. The 1,280 Inventories from the Gemeente Archief, listed by inventory number and date, include information on the owners’ lives, the appraisers, some original text in seventeenth-century Dutch, and additional commentary by Montias. The art database includes provenance, artists, and auction information for the 51,071 works of art. In addition, it contains prices for individual objects, making it possible to analyze values. The markdown file fieldnames.md should help guide users through the database’s fieldnames, abbreviations, and identifiers to improve ease of access.
